Below are short descriptions of what each assignment was about.

### Homework 1

Implement and use various models to learn and generate [two-moons dataset from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html) and [digits dataset from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html): 
- 2D histogram
- a single gaussian distribution
- a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
- a kernel density estimator (KDE)

Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) was used as a metric to compare the generated data with the original dataset.
